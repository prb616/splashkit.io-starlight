Title: Line Intersects Rectangle - SplashKit Usage Example

Description:
This usage example demonstrates how to use the 'line_intersects_rect' function in SplashKit to check if a line intersects a fixed rectangle. This interactive program allows users to drag the endpoints of a line and observe real-time feedback on intersection status, providing a practical understanding of geometry functions in SplashKit.

Code Overview:
The program opens an 800x600 pixel window titled 'Line Intersects Rect'. It initializes a draggable line with two endpoints and a fixed rectangle. The line's endpoints can be moved by clicking and dragging with the mouse, and the program checks for intersections with the rectangle on each frame.

Key Features:

Interactive Line Movement - Users can drag the start and end points of the line in real-time.

Intersection Detection - The program uses the 'line_intersects_rect' function to detect when the line crosses the rectangle.

Visual Feedback - A message indicating intersection is displayed when the line intersects the rectangle.

Top-Level C# Syntax - Utilizes the simplified static import syntax for concise and clear code.

Testing and Validation:
The program was tested in the SplashKit environment to ensure:

Accurate line dragging behavior.

Correct intersection detection for various line positions.

No performance issues during interaction.
